1. the naming convention for pthread function calls is to add
   "pthread_" to the beginning of the function call.
   (found in man pthreads)

2. POSIX Thread uses spinlocks, semaphores and mutexes to 
   synchronize the running threads. They are used to signal
   the threads to wake or sleep.
   (found in man pthreads)

3. it is good programming practice to do so because the
   predicate associated with the condition wait needs to be
   re evaluated to proceed safely.
   (found in pthread_cond_wait(3))

4. upon waking up from a condition variable, the thread is unlocked and
   may proceed to continue it's task.

5. if a thread blocks on a condition variable while holding two mutexes,
   it is possible that it may cause a deadlock if other threads use the two mutexes.

6. a detached thread is a thread which will release its resources back to the system.
